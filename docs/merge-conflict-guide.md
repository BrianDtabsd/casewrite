# VSCode Merge Conflict Resolution Guide

## Understanding the VSCode Merge Editor Interface

When you open a file with merge conflicts in VSCode and click "Resolve in Merge Editor", you'll see a three-panel view:

1. **Left panel (Current Changes)**: Shows your local version of the file (HEAD)
2. **Right panel (Incoming Changes)**: Shows the version from the branch you're merging in
3. **Result panel (bottom)**: Shows the final merged result

## Identifying Which Side is Which

- **Current Changes (Left)**: These are the changes in your current branch (what you've been working on)
- **Incoming Changes (Right)**: These are the changes from the branch you're merging in (e.g., from origin/main)

## Understanding the Buttons and Actions

In the merge editor, you'll see several buttons:

1. **Accept Current Change**: Takes the version from the left panel (your current branch)
2. **Accept Incoming Change**: Takes the version from the right panel (the branch being merged in)
3. **Accept Both Changes**: Includes both versions, with current changes first, then incoming
4. **Accept Combination**: Opens an editor to manually combine the changes

Additionally, there are buttons to navigate between conflicts if there are multiple in the file.

## How to Choose Which Version to Keep

To decide which version to keep:

1. **Review both versions** to understand the differences
2. If you want to keep your version (left panel), click "Accept Current Change"
3. If you want to keep the incoming version (right panel), click "Accept Incoming Change"
4. If you want to keep parts of both, use "Accept Combination" and edit manually

## Completing the Merge

After resolving all conflicts:

1. Save the file (Ctrl+S or Cmd+S)
2. The file will be marked as resolved
3. Stage the resolved file with `git add <filename>` or using the Source Control panel
4. Commit the changes with a message like "Resolve merge conflicts in <filename>"
5. Push the changes to the repository with `git push`

## Example: Resolving README.md Conflict

In your specific case with README.md:

1. The left panel showed your detailed README with comprehensive documentation
2. The right panel showed a simple one-line description
3. We chose to keep the detailed version (left panel/current changes) by clicking "Accept Current Change"
4. We then staged, committed, and pushed the resolved file

## Tips for Making the Right Choice

When deciding which version to keep:

1. **More detailed vs. less detailed**: Usually keep the more detailed version
2. **Newer vs. older**: Usually keep the newer changes
3. **Your work vs. others' work**: Consider the importance of both changes
4. **When in doubt**: Communicate with team members who made the other changes

Remember, you can always view the git history to understand who made which changes and when.
